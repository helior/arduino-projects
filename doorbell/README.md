## Doorbell hack

### Synopsis
I want to hijack my wireless doorbell to invoke a thing on my microprocessor. Essentially the doorbell will be used as a switch to power the board. The doorbell is powered by 3 1.5v C batteries.

### Challenges
* I'm not sure if I'll need to manage the voltage in case I'm over/under-powered
* The doorbell is soldered together so I'll need to destroy a few things ;)
* Potentially all I need is the wireless switch and I can provide my own power

### TODOs
* I'm assuming the doorbell switch will power the board only momentarily, not sure how long I have or if this power usage can be extended by scripting. This may be a limitation on what I can power to do a thing.
